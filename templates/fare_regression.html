<h1>Fare vs. Survival Regression Plot<br></h1>
<p>This regression plot helps analyze the relationship between ticket price (Fare) and survival probability.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>regression line</strong> predicts survival likelihood based on fare price.<br>
   The trend line suggests how increasing fare affects survival probability.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers with higher fares generally had a higher survival probability.</li>
    <li>The logistic regression curve models survival as a probability.</li>
    <li>Lower fares are associated with a lower chance of survival.</li>
    <li>Ignore the outlier its too far away from the main data to have any significance</li>
</ul>
