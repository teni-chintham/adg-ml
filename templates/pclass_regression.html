<h1>Pclass vs. Survival Regression Plot<br></h1>
<p>This regression plot helps analyze the relationship between ticket price (Pclass) and survival probability.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>regression line</strong> predicts survival likelihood based on Pclass price.<br>
   The trend line suggests how increasing Pclass affects survival probability.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers with higher Pclasses generally had a higher survival probability.</li>
    <li>The logistic regression curve models survival as a probability.</li>
    <li>Lower Pclasses are associated with a lower chance of survival.</li>
</ul>
