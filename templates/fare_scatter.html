<h1>Fare vs. Survival Scatter Plot<br></h1>
<p>This scatter plot visualizes how ticket price (Fare) relates to survival.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>scatter plot</strong> represents individual passengers.<br>
   The color distinguishes between those who survived (1) and those who did not (0).<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers with higher fares generally had a greater survival rate.</li>
    <li>Lower fare passengers were less likely to survive, reinforcing the link between fare and class.</li>
    <li>Since survival is binary (0 or 1), the density of points is key for regression analysis.</li>
    <li>There is an outlier above $500 that is too isolated to significantly impact the overall trend.</li>
</ul>
