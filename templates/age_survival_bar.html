<p>This visualization explores how Age influenced survival rates on the Titanic.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Bar Plot Show?<br></h2>

   A <strong>U-shaped trend</strong> is observed, meaning survival rates varied significantly with age.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers <strong>under 30</strong> had a relatively higher survival rate.</li>
    <li>The survival rate <strong>decreased</strong> for those aged <strong>30 to 50</strong>.</li>
    <li>Passengers <strong>over 50</strong> had slightly better survival chances compared to those in the 30-50 range.</li>
