<h1>Age vs. Survival Regression Plot<br></h1>
<p>This regression plot examines the relationship between Age and survival probability.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>regression line</strong> estimates the probability of survival based on Age.<br>
   A **U-shaped trend** emerges, but survival probability appears to **decline for passengers over 50**, possibly due to their **lower representation** in the dataset.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Children and younger passengers had a **higher** survival probability.</li>
    <li>Passengers aged **30-50** had the **lowest** survival rates.</li>
    <li>Survival probability **seems to decrease for 50+ passengers**, but this is likely due to their **lower numbers in the dataset**.</li>
</ul>
