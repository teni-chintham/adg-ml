<h1>Fare vs. Survival Rate<br></h1>
<p>This visualization helps us understand the relationship between the ticket price (Fare) and survival rate.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>bar chart</strong> represents the survival rate at different fare prices.<br>
   The <strong>red trendline</strong> shows an overall trend in the survival rate based on fare values.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers who paid higher fares had a higher survival rate.</li>
    <li>The trendline suggests a positive correlation between fare and survival probability.</li>
    <li>Lower fare passengers had a significantly lower survival rate.</li>
    <li>Ignore the outlier its too far away from the main data to have any significance</li>
</ul>
