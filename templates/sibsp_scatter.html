<h1>SibSp vs. Survival Scatter Plot<br></h1>
<p>This scatter plot visualizes how ticket price (Sibsp) relates to survival.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>scatter plot</strong> represents individual passengers.<br>
   The color distinguishes between those who survived (1) and those who did not (0).<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers with higher Sibsp had a higher survival rate.</li>
    <li>Lower Sibsp passengers were less likely to survive.</li>
    <li>The separation between points highlights the correlation between class and survival.</li>
</ul>
