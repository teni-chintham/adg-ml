<h1>Pclass vs. Survival<br></h1>
<p>This bar plot examines the relationship between Passenger Class (Pclass) and Survival Rate on the Titanic.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Bar Plot Show?<br></h2>
<p>The graph represents the <strong>average survival rate</strong> for different Pclass categories.<br>
    A lower Pclass number (higher class) is associated with a higher probability of survival.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers in <strong>Pclass 1</strong> had the highest survival rate, while those in <strong>Pclass 3</strong> had the lowest.</li>
    <li>There is an almost linear trend where survival decreases as Pclass increases.</li>
    <li>This reinforces the idea that wealthier passengers in higher classes had better access to lifeboats and safety measures.</li>
</ul>
