<h1>Age vs. Survival Scatter Plot<br></h1>
<p>This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between Age and survival.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>scatter plot</strong> represents individual passengers, where color distinguishes survivors (1) from non-survivors (0).<br>
   Due to **fewer passengers in the 50+ age group**, survival rates in that range appear to decrease.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers aged **below 30** had a **higher survival rate**.</li>
    <li>Survival rates were **lowest between ages 30-50**.</li>
    <li>Although survival appears to drop for **50+ passengers**, this is likely influenced by their **smaller sample size**.</li>
</ul>
