<h1>Pclass vs. Survival Rate<br></h1>
<p>This visualization explores the relationship between Passenger Class (Pclass) and survival rate on the Titanic.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>bar chart</strong> displays the survival rate for each passenger class (Pclass).<br>
   The <strong>red trendline</strong> highlights the overall pattern in survival rates across different classes.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers in <strong>Pclass 1</strong> had the highest survival rate, while those in <strong>Pclass 3</strong> had the lowest.</li>
    <li>The trendline confirms a strong negative correlation between Pclass number and survival probability.</li>
    <li>Lower-class passengers faced significantly lower survival rates, likely due to limited access to lifeboats and safety measures.</li>
</ul>
