<h1>Sibsp vs. Survival Regression Plot<br></h1>
<p>This regression plot helps analyze the relationship between ticket price (Sibsp) and survival probability.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>regression line</strong> predicts survival likelihood based on Sibsp price.<br>
   The trend line suggests how increasing Sibsp affects survival probability.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers with higher Sibsp generally had a higher survival probability.</li>
    <li>The logistic regression curve models survival as a probability.</li>
    <li>Lower Sibsp are associated with a lower chance of survival.</li>
</ul>
