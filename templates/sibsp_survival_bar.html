<h1>SibSp vs. Survival<br></h1>
<p>This bar plot examines the relationship between the number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp) and survival rate on the Titanic.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Bar Plot Show?<br></h2>
<p>The graph represents the <strong>average survival rate</strong> for different SibSp values.<br>
   The pattern suggests that having **exactly one** sibling/spouse resulted in the **highest survival rate**, while larger families (SibSp = 4+) had much lower survival probabilities.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers with <strong>one sibling/spouse</strong> had the **highest survival rate**.</li>
    <li>Survival for <strong>zero siblings/spouses</strong> was similar to having **two**.</li>
    <li>Passengers with **four or more siblings/spouses** had the **lowest survival rate**.</li>
    <li>Having **too few or too many** family members onboard may have impacted survival decisions.</li>
</ul>
