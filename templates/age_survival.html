<h1>Age vs. Survival Rate<br></h1>
<p>This visualization explores how Age influenced survival rates on the Titanic.<br><br></p>

<h2>What Does This Graph Show?<br></h2>
<p>The <strong>bar chart</strong> represents the survival rate at different age ranges.<br>
   The <strong>red trendline</strong> highlights the overall survival trend across ages.<br><br></p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:<br></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Passengers <strong>under 30</strong> had a relatively higher survival rate.</li>
    <li>Survival rates <strong>dropped</strong> for those aged <strong>30 to 50</strong>, indicating a lower chance of survival.</li>
    <li>Passengers <strong>over 50</strong> had a slight rebound in survival rates.</li>
    <li>This creates a <strong>U-shaped trend</strong>, where younger and older passengers had better survival chances than middle-aged adults.</li>
</ul>
